## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See CI/CD for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In this project we use various tools and technologies for development and deployment, to be able to work you will have to install the following:

- [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- yarn `npm i -g yarn`
- typescript `npm i -g typescript`

### Configurations

Configurations are declared within the `.env` file. In the repository, `.env-example` file is available with the full list of variable available.

These variables can be either declared in `.env` file as described above or passed as environments variables. Server support validation for env variables and will fail to load if some of them are missing or in wrong format.

_NOTE: if you are adding new env variables please make sure to add them into `.env-example` file with explanation._

**NEVER COMMIT `.env` FILE TO REPOSITORY**

### Database Seed

To seed initial data please cd in db-seed run:

    yarn install

Then to run seed script(with clean flag):

    yarn seed

for Mac you can also go to db-seed folder and run:

    ./seed -n msw-dev mongodb://localhost:27017

for Windows, go to db-seed folder and run:

    node ./seed -n msw-dev mongodb://localhost:27017

if you change the seed process (when editing seed.ts), make sure you run 'yarn seed-compile' when finished.

The following users will be created:

- `principle`
- `teacher`
- `student`

The initial password for all users: **Aa123456**

### First Thing First

Run the following commmands in your terminal to get your code running on your local machine:

Get the code

```
git clone https://github.com/myspecialway/my-special-way-server.git
cd my-special-way-server
```

Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

Start the server

```
yarn start
```

### Running the tests

The below will run both the Unit and the E2E tests

```
yarn test
```

You can also run unittests and e2e tests separately with

- `yarn test:ut`
- `yarn test:e2e`

The test will run also on CI once you do your first commit.

### Coding style tests

Based on [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) - please refer to [tslint.json](tslint.json) for definition of the rules.
Violations will fail your builds.
Adding TSLint plugin to your IDE will spare you the trouble of fixing after the commit

## Deployment

Commit to master through a PR will bump the version, update docker hub with your image and deploy to Azure.
Commit to your branch will update to docker hub with custom tag, you will need to run the docker manually for now.

## Built With

- Nodejs
- Nest
- Graphql
